# Pixelite Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the Pixelite web application! This React-based project allows digital artists to create pixel art using a range of square canvas sizes. Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling, and JavaScript arrays are used for pixel management instead of an HTML canvas. The application features canvas size selection, color palette customization, and the ability to download the created pixel art. The project is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Canvas Sizes**: Users can choose from a fixed range of square canvas sizes to suit their artistic preferences.

- **Color Palette**: Change the color of your 'pen' to create vibrant and dynamic pixel art.

- **Download Artwork**: Save your pixel art creations by downloading them directly from the application.
